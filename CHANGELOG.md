## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-07

First release.

### Added

- `npx @aivolution/isitdone`: detects the repository's test, typecheck, lint and build commands (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun/deno scripts, pytest/ruff/mypy/pyright/flake8, `go vet`/`go test`, `cargo check`/`cargo test`, .NET, Gradle/Maven, Makefile targets), runs them in a subprocess with timeouts, prints PASS/FAIL per check with the failing output tail, and exits 0 or 1.
- Receipts: `.isitdone/receipt.json` bound to a hash of the exact working tree (tracked changes and untracked files, via a temporary git index), the check configuration, and an HMAC key. `isitdone receipt` reports PASS, FAIL, STALE (files changed since) or NONE; `--md` prints a table for PR bodies; `--json` is a done-predicate for scripts.
- Stop hook for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor and Gemini CLI (`isitdone hook --host <name>`): reads the host payload from stdin, claim-gates the expensive checks on the agent's final message, caches PASS receipts per tree, cooperates with each host's loop protection, caps consecutive blocks (`maxAttempts`, default 3), and never breaks the agent on malformed input or internal errors.
- `isitdone init`: idempotently writes the hook into `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json` or `.gemini/settings.json` (project scope by default, `--user` for user scope), adds `.isitdone/` to `.gitignore`, and runs `doctor`.
- `isitdone doctor`: pipes a synthetic "all tests pass" stop event through every installed hook and proves it blocks; reports detected checks, git state and host-specific trust steps.
- `.isitdone.json` / `package.json#isitdone` configuration: override or disable checks, add custom ones, set profile (`claim-gated`, `lite`, `full`), timeouts, `maxAttempts`, extra claim patterns.
- `SKILL.md` so agents can install the behaviour with `npx skills add raimondasl/isitdone`.
